Python CLI tool to monitor AWS cost data (mock or file-based) and alert on high spend thresholds. Simulates FinOps automation for anomaly detection, inspired by Cost Explorer/Bedrock forecasting (mock-only for demo).

## Features
- Customizable threshold and JSON input.
- Error handling for robust runs.
- Ties to enterprise savings (e.g., 15% improved visibility in simulations).

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArytonBayer25/aws-cost-alert-tool.git
cd aws-cost-alert-tool
# No pip install needed
